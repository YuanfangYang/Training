1.A Java variable is a container that holds data.dataType variableName = value;
2.Primitive Data Types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean； 
Reference Data Types: String, Arrays, Objects；
3.byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean
4.A wrapper class is an object representation of a primitive data type, allowing primitives to be used as objects.
Collections do not support primitive types.Provide additional methods like parseInt(), toString()
5.Pass by Value: A copy of the value is passed. Changes do not affect the original value (used for primitive types).
Pass by Reference: A reference to the actual object is passed. Changes affect the original object (used for objects and arrays).
6.An immutable class is a class whose objects cannot be modified once created.
7.Declare the class as final to prevent subclassing.
Mark all fields as private final to ensure immutability.
Do not provide setter methods.
Initialize fields via a constructor.
8.The String pool is a special memory area in Java that stores unique string literals to prevent duplicate objects.
9.System.out.println(5 & 6); // 4
System.out.println(5 | 6); // 7
System.out.println(5 ^ 6); // 3
10.Without break, the execution falls through to the next case.
11.private: Within the class only
   default: Within the same package
   protected: Same package + subclasses
   public: everywhere
12.  Static field: Shared among all instances of the class.
     Static method: Can be called without creating an object.
13.public → Allows JVM to access it from anywhere.
   static → JVM calls it without creating an object.
   void → Does not return a value.
   String[] args → Accepts command-line arguments.
